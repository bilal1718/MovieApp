# Movie Recommendation App

This is a movie recommendation app that allows users to search for movies and get recommendations based on their search query. The app fetches movie data from an external API and displays movie cards with information such as title, rating, and overview. It also supports random movie fetching and infinite scrolling to load more movies.

## Features

- Search movies: Users can enter a search query to find movies matching their input.
- Random movie fetching: The app fetches random movies from the API and displays them in movie cards.
- Infinite scrolling: As the user scrolls to the end of the page, more movie cards are loaded dynamically.
- Responsive design: The app is designed to adapt to different screen sizes and provide a consistent user experience.
